Hi there! 👋
I'm an experienced Web3 developer with a passion for decentralizing the world 🌍. 
Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on several cutting-edge blockchain projects, winning multiple hackathons 🏆 along the way. 
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.


Feel free to reach out if you want to build cool things together!
